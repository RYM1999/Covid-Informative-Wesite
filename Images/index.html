<h3>           In early 2020, a new virus began generating headlines all over the world because of the unprecedented speed of its transmission.

From its origins in a food market in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 to countries as far-flung as the United States and the Philippines, the virus (officially named SARS-CoV-2) has affected hundreds of thousands, with a rising death toll now over 17,000.

The disease caused by an infection with SARS-CoV-2 is called COVID-19, which stands for coronavirus disease 2019.

In spite of the global panic in the news about this virus, you’re unlikely to contract SARS-CoV-2 unless you’ve been in contact with someone who has a SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Let’s bust some myths. Read on to learn how this 2019 coronavirus is spread, how it’s similar and different from other coronaviruses, and how to prevent spreading it to others if you suspect you’ve contracted this virus.</h3>

<h1>What is a coronavirus?</h1>

<h2><img src="./index_files/d.jpg" alt="d" style="width: 350px;height: 350px;margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 30px">
A coronavirus is a virus that is found in animals and, rarely, can be transmitted from animals to humans and then spread person to person. In addition to COVID-19, other human coronaviruses have included:
The MERS virus, or Middle East respiratory syndrome.
The SARS virus, or severe acute respiratory syndrome, which first occurred in the Guangdong province in southern China.
 An outbreak of the coronavirus (now called COVID-19) in China is causing global concern. It came from a seafood and meat market in Wuhan, China, in December. It has since spread to other countries, including the United States.
Despite Wuhan and other Chinese cities being quarantined, the COVID-19 has spread to almost 70 locationsinternationally. In the U.S., COVID-19 cases have been confirmed and deaths have been reported.</h2>
