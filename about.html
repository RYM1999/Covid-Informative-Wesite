	<h2>COVID-19 is the infectious disease caused by the most recently discovered coronavirus. This new virus and disease were unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019.</h2>
			<h2>Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses which may cause illness in animals or humans. In humans, several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The most recently discovered coronavirus causes coronavirus disease COVID-19. </h2>
			<br>
			<h1> Other types of coronaviruses</h1>
<h2>
The word corona means “crown,” and when examined closely, the round virus has a “crown” of proteins called peplomers jutting out from its center in every direction. These proteins help the virus identify whether it can infect its host.

The condition known as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was also linked to a highly infectious coronavirus back in the early 2000s. The SARS virus has since been contained.</h2>
<br>
<h1>What causes a coronavirus infection?</h1>
<h2>
Humans first get a coronavirus from contact with animals. Then, it can spread from human to human. Health officials do not know what animal caused COVID-19.

The COVID-19 virus can be spread through contact with certain bodily fluids, such as droplets in a cough. It might also be caused by touching something an infected person has touched and then touching your hand to your mouth, nose, or eyes.</h2>

<h1>How is a coronavirus diagnosed?</h1>
<h2>If you believe you have COVID-19, you should contact your family doctor immediately. Before going to the doctor’s office, call with your concerns. This will allow the office to collect information and offer you guidance on next steps. To diagnose you, your doctor may run tests to rule out other common infections. In some cases, your doctor may suggest you self-isolate to prevent the spread of infection. The FDA has also seen unauthorized fraudulent test kitsfor COVID-19 being sold online. Currently, the only way to be tested for COVID-19 is to talk to your family doctor.</h2>

<h1>Coronavirus treatment</h1>
<h2>There is currently no vaccine or treatment for COVID-19. Symptoms of a coronavirus usually go away on their own. If symptoms feel worse than a common cold, contact your doctor. He or she may prescribe pain or fever medication. The FDA is currently advising people to be cautious of websites and stores selling products that claim to prevent, treat or cure COVID-19. Additionally, do not take any form of chloroquine unless it has been prescribed for you by your family doctor and purchased from a legitimate source.

As with a cold or the flu, drink fluids and get plenty of rest. If you are having trouble breathing, seek immediate medical care.

</h2>
<h1>Living with a coronavirus</h1>
<h2>When possible, avoid contact with others when you are sick. If you have COVID-19, wear a facemask to prevent spreading the virus to others. The CDC does not recommend wearing a mask if you do not have COVID-19</h2>
